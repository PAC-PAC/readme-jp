# ML AI team skill map

At MonstarLab, we are currently seeing an increase in the requests for AI projects as they impact on every industry and business. In this context, AI capable engineers will play an important role for developing MonstarLab digital transformations activities. Based on skills, demonstrated capacities in previous projects and the official MonstarLab consulting & specialist skills ladder, employees will be given a ranking.
In following can be seen the specialist skill ladder at MonstarLab.

# AI engineer upscaling ladder

## Purpose
In order to upgrade CS ranking, an AI upscaling ladder is proposed.
The target of this course is to encourage MonstarLab employees to learn AI-related content and transition to AI related projects, while using their existing background to provide added value. 
Based on learnt content, demonstrated capacities in previous projects and the official MonstarLab consulting & specialist skills ladder, employees will be given a new title and a new contract.

## How does it work?

Each candidate will answer a survey to understand technical knowledge (programming language, statistics,...) and motivation (career target) to build relevant course content. Based on output of the survey, training content and schedule will be proposed to candidates.
Weekly meetings will also be conducted to discuss interactively the content of the class with AI engineers. This will also help to improve the content of the classes based on the candidate feedback.
An arrangement will be made with the candidate manager in order to optimize work assignments during the training period. Training is not expected to take more than 50% of the candidate's schedule.


# Artificial intelligence certifications:

In order to professionalize ML AI team members, online certification classes are considered
Target is to learn new skills based on an online course. 
That could be courses that made you remember previously learnt knowledge (AI fields are various and it is impossible to cover them all), or learn actual deployment of models using online platforms. Moreover, adding certifications to our presentation slide would make more impact during customer meetings to win projects.

Thus three points are considered:
- ML / DL / NLP concepts and related courses.
- Model deployments using AWS / GCP / Azure.
- ML ops solution.
